          <h1>We Teach Agility</h1>
          <p class="mt-3">
            We believe that no cookie cutter system will fit all handler and dog combinations. We tailor the training to fit the needs of the handler and dog in the class. No two combinations are the same. We will say that there is a base line that we start with but then vary that to match the strengths of the team.
          </p>
          <p class="mt-3">
          I started teach to help myself to better understand the behaviors of both the handler and the dogs.  I felt that if I were able to help others that it too would help my handling and performance.  The longer that I taught the better that is made me as a person.  There are so many wonderful people in this sport with so much to offer.  I continue to learn from each person I come in contact with and still 20+ years later enjoy the sport in general.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-3">
          One of the amazing moments that I think I enjoy most when teaching a handler and dog combo is to watch the "light bulb" moments with each of them when things really start to work the way they think it should work.  A moment can be when the handler has the trust of the training while in the ring and sends the dog in one direction and heads to in another direction.  You really have to watch the first time but it is magical to see the expression on the handlers face that it worked and they now trust the training they have worked so hard with their dog.  So many of these moments really makes this sport so much fun to run and to watch.

          <h1>Motivators</h1>
          <p class="mt-3">
            To be successful in your early training with the puppy/dog, we need to find its motivator.  Each puppy/dog is unique and will have a different motivator.  With some it can be food/treats, with others it can be a toy and yet others it can be just attention from you.  Some it can be a combination and others it may take a while to find it.
          </p>
          <p class="mt-3">
            Example of treat/food motivation:  Our Border Collie Kaci is highly treat/food motivated and I discovered that she will do anything for a cooked hot dog.  Once I found this out, I would only use cooked hot dogs when we were learning something new.  I did not want to give her so many that it wore off the effect of the motivation.
            If I need to go back and work on something that we are having issues with then I will bring the cooked hot dog back out.
            This allows me to get her undivided attention and she focuses on what I am teaching her.
          </p>
          <p class="mt-3">
            Example of toy motivation:  Our Border Collie Reagan is highly ball focused. Anyone in the family can bring out a ball and he will stop eating to go play ball.  With his focus on the ball I can teach him anything as his reward for doing what I want is for me to throw the ball.  I get what I want and he gets what he wants.  Makes training fun for both of us.
          </p>
          <p class="mt-3">
            Example of attention motivation:  I would usually say that as motivators go that treats/food would be number 1 and toys/balls would be slightly behind in 2nd and then attention would be a distant 3rd.  The longer I am in the sport and the more that I learn, I am finding out that attention is a must for all dogs.  They work with us for the attention.  Mia my first Border Collie would take the treat but wanted the attention more.  Our Corgi Fred-D too is highly food motivated but wants the attention from me to run in the ring.  His motivator changed based on his needs.  Our newest Border Collie Betty is highly attention motivated.  She want attention more than anything else at this stage in her life.
          </p>
          <p class="mt-3">
            Be prepared to learn about yourself and your companion while enjoying the sport of agility.  It is a very fun journey if you allow it to be.
